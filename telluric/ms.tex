% Then Acknowledgement
% Thank John Johnson for providing CPS Doppler code.
\acknowledgements
% John
The authors thank John A. Johnson for providing a copy of his Doppler
code and his help with our incorporation of the code into the HET
pipeline.  The authors also thank Debra Fischer for her assistance in
this regard.

% CEHW
This work was partially supported by funding from the Center for
Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds, which is supported by the
Pennsylvania State University, the Eberly College of Science, and the
Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium.

% Financial support acknowledgement
The authors appreciate the significant Keck observing time and
associated funding support from NASA for the study of long period
planets and mulitplanet systems.
%
J.T.W.\ and S.X.W.\ acknowledge support from NASA Origins of Solar
Systems grant NNX10AI52G.

% Keck
The work herein is based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck
Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California
and the California Institute of Technology.  The Keck Observatory was
made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck
Foundation.  We wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant
cultural role and reverence that the summit of Mauna Kea has always
had within the indigenous Hawaiian community.  We are most fortunate
to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.

% HET
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope is a joint project of the University of
Texas at Austin, the Pennsylvania State University, Stanford
University, Ludwig Maximillians Universit\"at M\"unchen, and Georg
August Universit\"at G\"ottingen. The HET is named in honor of its
principal benefactors, William P. Hobby and Robert E. Eberly.
